# Module Three Challenge Report

## Overview of the Project
---

Election commission was given an election audit done by Seth and Tom. However, they requested both of them to add these data to complete the audit: 

* The voter turnout for each county.
* The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
* The county with the highest turnout. 

In this challenge, the request will be fullfiled using python, and the election_results.csv file. 

## Resuls
---

From the figure below, the following can be concluded:
- The winner from the election is Diana DeGette and the the winning percentage is 73.8%. 
- As for the county section, the county turnout is Denver. It can be noticed that almost all the votes were coming from Denver.

## Summary
---

- For future use for the code in coming elections, the data should be stored and tabulated in the same manner as in provided csv file **election_results.csv**. 
- The fist modification that can be done for code is adding the ability to count the number of votes for each candidate from the participating counties. In addition to that, there is a need the urn out percentage with the statement of the winning county.
- Also, this analysis can be easier to perform using pandas.
