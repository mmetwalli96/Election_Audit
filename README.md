# Module Three Challenge Report

## Overview of the Project
---

Election commission was given an election audit done by Seth and Tom. However, they requested both of them to add these data to complete the audit: 

* The voter turnout for each county.
* The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
* The county with the highest turnout. 

In this challenge, the request will be fullfiled using python, and the election_results.csv file.
